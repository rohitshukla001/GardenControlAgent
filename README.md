![resized floraos_official](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8359be-a0af-42d6-a9af-a5aafb523832)

The Smart Garden Automation System, FloraOS, is an intelligent platform for urban garden management, built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). It demonstrates the power of multi-agent systems to automate complex environmental monitoring and decision-making processes. FloraOS coordinates weather, soil health, and plant vision data to provide actionable insights and simulated automated responses for gardeners, showcasing how sophisticated automation, typically seen in robotics or IT, can be applied to biological and environmental systems. This project directly addresses the "Automation of Complex Processes" challenge by designing a multi-agent workflow to manage the intricate tasks of urban gardening.

## Core Problem & Our Solution

Managing urban gardens involves constant monitoring of diverse data (soil, weather, plant health) and coordinating actions (watering, nutrients). Manual management is inefficient.

**FloraOS automates this by orchestrating four distinct agents via ADK:**

1.  **SoilSensorAgent:** Simulates soil sensor readings (moisture, pH, NPK) from a predefined dataset, publishing structured data.
2.  **WeatherAgent:** Fetches current weather and forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API (or simulated data), publishing structured weather updates.
3.  **PlantVisionAgent:** Analyzes plant images using **Google Cloud Vertex AI Vision** (Custom Classification Model) to assess health status (e.g., "Needs Water," "Nutrient Deficient"), publishing these assessments.
4.  **GardenControlAgent (The Brain):** Subscribes to data from all other agents. Applies rule-based logic (e.g., if soil is dry, no rain forecasted, and plant is wilting, then trigger watering) and publishes (simulated) action commands.

This creates an automated feedback loop for garden care.

## ‚ú® Features & Functionality

**Overview:** FloraOS automates the monitoring and management of a simulated urban garden by orchestrating specialized agents that gather diverse environmental data, analyze it, and determine appropriate actions.

**Key Features & Innovation**

*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration with ADK:** Demonstrates ADK's power to coordinate specialized agents for a complex task.
*   **AI-Powered Perception:** Integrates Vertex AI Vision for intelligent plant health assessment from images.
*   **Autonomous Decision-Making:** The GardenControlAgent makes data-driven decisions based on inputs from multiple sources.
*   **Environmental Automation:** Applies sophisticated automation concepts to a biological/environmental system.
*   **Structured Data Flow:** Clear JSON message schemas for robust inter-agent communication.

**Detailed Breakdown & Agent Orchestration:**

FloraOS employs a multi-agent system where each agent has a distinct role, communicating and collaborating via ADK to automate the garden management workflow:
  
1.  **SoilSensorAgent:**
    *   **Function:** Simulates reading and publishing crucial soil sensor data.
    *   **Data:** Generates or reads from a predefined dataset (CSV/JSON) mimicking soil conditions (moisture %, pH, nutrient levels - NPK). This data is structured similarly to an IoT Core message payload.
    *   **Output:** Publishes structured soil data (e.g., `{ "timestamp": "...", "location": "Bed A", "moisture": 45.2, "ph": 6.5, "nitrogen": 10, "phosphorus": 5, "potassium": 8 }`).
    *   **Automation Role:** Provides foundational ground-truth data for decision-making.

2.  **WeatherAgent:**
    *   **Function:** Fetches current weather conditions and short-term forecast data.
    *   **Data:** Uses a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for real-time data or a simulated forecast dataset for reliability.
    *   **Output:** Publishes structured weather data (e.g., `{ "timestamp": "...", "location": "Garden Area", "temp_c": 22.0, "humidity": 60, "precipitation_prob_next_12h": 0.1, "uv_index": 5 }`).
    *   **Automation Role:** Introduces external environmental factors into the decision matrix.

3.  **PlantVisionAgent:**
    *   **Function:** Analyzes simulated images of plants to assess their health status.
    *   **Data:** Takes pre-selected image files representing different plant states (healthy, wilting, nutrient deficient, pest infestation).
    *   **GCP Integration:** Utilizes **Google Cloud Vertex AI Vision API** (a Custom Classification model trained on example images) to classify the plant's condition.
    *   **Output:** Publishes plant health assessment (e.g., `{ "timestamp": "...", "plant_id": "Tomato Plant 1", "image_ref": "sim_img_001.jpg", "status": "Needs Water", "confidence": 0.85 }`).
    *   **Automation Role:** Adds a sophisticated perception layer, enabling direct assessment of plant well-being.

4.  **GardenControlAgent (The "Brain"):**
    *   **Function:** Subscribes to data streams from the SoilSensorAgent, WeatherAgent, and PlantVisionAgent. It applies decision logic to determine necessary actions for garden management.
    *   **Decision Logic (MVP):** Rule-based. Examples:
        *   `IF SoilSensorAgent.moisture < threshold AND WeatherAgent.precipitation_prob_next_12h < low_threshold AND PlantVisionAgent.status == "Needs Water" THEN trigger watering.`
        *   `IF PlantVisionAgent.status == "Potential Nutrient Deficiency" THEN trigger specific nutrient delivery.`
        *   `IF SoilSensorAgent.ph outside optimal range THEN recommend pH adjustment action.`
    *   **Output:** Publishes simulated actuation commands (e.g., `{ "timestamp": "...", "action": "ACTIVATE_WATERING", "target": "Bed A", "duration_minutes": 5 }`).
    *   **Automation Role:** Orchestrates the overall process by consuming information from specialized agents, making intelligent decisions, and dispatching commands, thus automating a complex multi-step feedback loop.
